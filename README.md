# Battleship
For this project, you will create an implementation of the popular board game Battleship. Battleship is a guessing game for two (human) players, no AI or computer opponents are required for this project assignment. The most basic version of the game is played on a square board of dimension 8-by-8 consisting of 64 grey-colored tiles. A number of ships are located on the board. During each playerâ€™s turn, the player clicks on a grey tile and it will be revealed whether she/he hit a ship or the water. If the player hit the water, the grey tile turns blue. If the player hit a ship, the tile turns a specific color, depending upon the color of the ship that has been hit. There are four different types of ships, with each ship having a unique name, size, and color (you can decide upon the colors yourself or even use images, although be warned that this might complicate your implementation considerably):
